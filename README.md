A C program demonstrating the solution for Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.
# üè∞ Tower of Hanoi in C

A simple C program demonstrating the *Tower of Hanoi* puzzle using *recursion*.

## üìò Overview
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes.  
The goal is to move all the disks from the *source rod* to the *destination rod* following these rules:

1. Only *one disk* can be moved at a time.  
2. You can move only the *top disk* from any rod.  
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller one.

This program prints the *step-by-step sequence of moves* required to solve the puzzle for a given number of disks.

## üß† Concepts Used
- Recursion  
- Function calls and stack behavior  
- Algorithmic problem-solving

## üñ• How It Works
1. The user inputs the number of disks.  
2. The program recursively moves disks between rods following the Tower of Hanoi rules.  
3. Each move is printed on the screen.
